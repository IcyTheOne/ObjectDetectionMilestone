# ObjectDetection
C# Project demonstrating the use of ObjectDetection with Deeplearning models TinyYolov2 and Yolov2

# To run the project, two deep learning models have to be added to the project first
TinyYolov2 and Yolov2 
They can be downloaded at: 

https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/tiny-yolov2


https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/yolov2-coco

Place them into a new folder called "Model". Name the models "TinyYolo2_model.onnx" and "yolov2-coco-9.onnx" or change the path code to match the file names.
